# The Home of All Things Configuration
This repository contains all of the configurations I need for my commonly used tools across my systems. 

## My Toolchain
1. Neovim: Home base for me when writing code, tracking my time, and manipulating text.
2. Obsidian: The home of my Notes.
3. WezTerm: My terminal emulator of choice.

## This Repository
* Branch `windows` functions as a digital flash drive implementation of my setup for getting going on different systems at work. It contains all of the executables for running bash, WezTerm, and Neovim in a comfortable configuration for me.
* Branch `macos` contains my dotfiles for my home setup. Here my shell of choice is `zsh`, so the files are adapted to accommodate the difference.
