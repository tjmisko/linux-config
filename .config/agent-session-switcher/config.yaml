system_prompt_additions: |
  After each response, write a one-line status summary and priority to
  the file at $AGENT_STATE_DIR/summary. Format:
  PRIORITY: <1-5>
  SUMMARY: <one sentence describing current state and next action needed>
  Priority guidelines:
  - 5 (critical): ~/Projects work that is blocked or failing tests
  - 4 (high): active ~/Projects feature work
  - 3 (normal): routine changes, refactoring
  - 2 (low): configuration changes, dotfiles
  - 1 (minimal): documentation, cosmetic changes

priority_rules: |
  Projects under ~/Projects/ are highest priority.
  Configuration and dotfile changes are low priority.
  Failing tests or blocked work is always critical.
